SPOILR

Mystery Hunt-Running Django App.


Requires django >= 1.4
Designed to run under apache with mod_wsgi

Requires an actual hunt structure and info to be present in /home/hunt before this will work. This should be in some other git repo somewhere.

Required config files:
my.cnf (use my.cnf.EXAMPLE as a template)
spoilr/settings.py (use settings.py.EXAMPLE as a template)

Commands:
reset.sh -- re-initializes everything based on hunt structure and team data (including wiping database)
	will also install crontab and basic apache conf, syslog settings, and probably some other stuff

./manage republish_all -- republishes hunt for all teams (based on hunt structure in /home/hunt)

./manage load_data -- reloads data for all teams (based on team data in /home/hunt)
